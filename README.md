# ROMAM: An Traffic-aware Distributed Routing Protocol Framework

## Overview

ROMAM (ROuting Module Architecture for MAchine learning) is an innovative intra-autonomous system (AS) routing architecture designed to accelerate the research and development of intelligent routing protocols. It offers a modular, highly adaptable framework that integrates both static and dynamic network information, enabling swift prototyping and assessment of advanced routing solutions.

## Key Features

- Modular Architecture for flexible routing protocol development
- Integration of static and dynamic network information
- Support for rapid prototyping and evaluation of routing protocols
- Comprehensive monitoring toolchain for pre-deployment evaluation
- Significant reduction in development efforts
- Native support for machine learning integration in routing decisions

## Core Components

1. Information Collection Module (ICM)
2. Route Discovery Module (RDM)
3. Traffic Detection Module (TDM)
4. Intelligent Forwarding Module (IFM)

## Implemented Protocols

- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- K-Shortest Path Routing
- Octopus (MAB-based Intelligent Forwarding)
- DGR (Delay Guaranteed Routing)
- DDR (Deadline-Driven Routing)
